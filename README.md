# AntiPiracySupport

ATTN: AntiPiracySupport is slated for depreciation for V2.

Report new piracy markets and malware to anyone involved on the team or get help us out by 
getting involved.  Pull requests are welcome!  If you'd like to join the project just ask.

If you're interested in helping to support us it makes more sense to track than it does to fork since 
it is going to be maintained here.. but if you fork please be sure to look for updates regularly.
